Steps performed for the anomaly detection task
-> Scaling (bcoz given 2 features were not scaled)
-> undersampling - visualizing- removing extreme outliers - predicting - grid search for best hyperparameters - plotting results
-> Oversampling- visualizing - removing extreme outliers - predicting - grid search if req.- plotting results


Two features amount and time were not scaled, so how to decide which scaling fn(log scaler, min-max, robust, standard)  to use
Use box plot to visualize feature with the target variable and find which scaler is best distributed.
In this case, used  log scaler

Used undersampled data to first create a balanced dataset
How to balance dataset- take all the rows with fraud class(492 rows) and randomly sample the same size of non fraud class i.e. 492 rows.

then used various ML algorithms to develop different classifiers 
	Logistics regression
	Random forest
	SVM
	Decision tree
Used grid search approach to find the hyperparameters which leads to best cross-validation results.
Logistics regression performed best with maximum accuracy score and roc score
 -> recall and f1 scores for fraud transaction class came out to be very low(0.06,0.11) on the testing set.

Used oversampling technique to generate a balanced dataset from the original dataset and repeat the above steps
Random forest outperforms the other two classifiers with an accuracy of more than 99% and a high f1 score for both the fraud and nonfraud class
